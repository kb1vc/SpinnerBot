# SpinnerBot
A Simple RC Bot with a Scoop or Spinner

The Bot
------
This bot can be configured with a front and rear
scoop, or a front spinner mount and a rear scoop.

All plastic parts can be printed on a small 3D printer. I've built them on a Moniprice Select Mini. 

See below for the list of parts


A Note on Dimensions
------

Most of the shop here uses imperial measurements.  (In particular, all the
rulers and calipers are imperial.)  This means that much of the designs from
this shop are stuck in the 19th century.  There are a few places, however,
where one cannot escape the metric system.  So, some parts are imperial (6-32 scres, for instance) and others are metric (the motor mount M3 screws).

Sumus quod sumus.
